annotation\_dashboard
====================

ClioPatria Cpack implementing an admin dashboard for the image annotation cpack.

See http://cliopatria.swi-prolog.org/ for details on deployment.

Initial code base developed with funding from the COMMIT SEALINCMedia project.
The layout is based on the bootstap Dashboard template.
Interface design is based on designs made by Alessandro Bosson.

Note that the dashboard might expose privacy-sensitive information of annotators on the web.
Therefore, web access by default requires admin rights. The admin user can disable this in the options.
